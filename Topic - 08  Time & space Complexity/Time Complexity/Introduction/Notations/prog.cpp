Notations fo diff types of time complexity-

    1. Big O
    2. omega
    3. theta


    # Big O
           - considerd as a uppr bound
           
           ------- types------
           
           - O(n)
           - O(n^2)
           - O(logn)
           - O(n^3)
           - O(2^n)
           - O(1)


    ## time taking order

        O(log n) < O(n) < O(n^2)
