    ## Greedy - logically or mathmatically certain one path and go ahead. dont explore every path just explore and at that time what does it best suite.

        # problem Identify - Mostly its problems based on Priority Queue or sort
        # some time it can't give bests solution.
        # it provide fast solution (Focus on Performance)

        # Algorithms - Fractional Knapsack, Dijkstra's algorithm, Kruskal's algorithm, Huffman coding and Prim's Algorith.

    ## Most of the problems where greedy algorithms work follow these two properties:

    1). Greedy Choice Property:- This property states that choosing the best possible option at each step will lead to the best overall solution. If this is not true, a greedy approach may not work.

    2). Optimal Substructure:- This means that you can break the problem down into smaller parts, and solving these smaller parts by making greedy choices helps solve the overall problem.
