    ## Algorithmic Paradigms 

        1. Brute Force - Find all the possible Possibilites and finally choose one that best suite.

        2. Dynamic Pro - it is the optimization techniues of brute force (Space or Time).

        3. Devide & Concquer - devide big problem into small and solve Ex. Merge,quick & Binary search. 

        - Recursive  problem also devided into sub problems but it is diff from from devide and conquer becuase here  problem repition exiest here where as it does not exiest in devide

        4. Greedy - logically or mathmatically certain one path and go ahead. dont explore every path just explore and at that time what does it best suite.

        - problem Identification-Mostly its problems based on Priority Queue or sort
        - some time it can't give bests solution
